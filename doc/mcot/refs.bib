    abstract = {Artificial life attempts to understand the essential general
                properties of living systems by synthesizing life-like behavior
                in software, hardware and biochemicals. As many of the essential
                abstract properties of living systems (e.g. autonomous adaptive
                and intelligent behavior) are also studied by cognitive science,
                artificial life and cognitive science have an essential overlap.
                This review highlights the state of the art in artificial life
                with respect to dynamical hierarchies, molecular
                self-organization, evolutionary robotics, the evolution of
                complexity and language, and other practical applications. It
                also speculates about future connections between artificial life
                and cognitive science.},
